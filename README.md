Practice questions with spaced repetition for the North Carolina pesticide
applicator certification exams: the 100-question commercial Core exam, the
50-question Private Applicator exam, and the Aerial Methods exam every aerial
applicator adds on top, all passed at 70%. The bank has 738 questions, written
with the recipe in
[docs/question-authoring.md](docs/question-authoring.md) and covering both
manuals end to end: all eleven chapters of the
[National Pesticide Applicator Certification Core Manual](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-09/national-pesticide-applicator-cert-core-manual-2014.pdf)
(second edition, 2014) and all six of the
[National Aerial Applicator's Manual](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-11/national-aerial-applicator-manual-2014.pdf)
(2014), plus the appendices of each that teach something a test could ask:
conversions and calibration math, Safety Data Sheets, FAA requirements for
agricultural aircraft, heat stress, spill cleanup, and GPS. Every question
cites the manual page it was drawn from, as a link that opens that PDF at that
page.

Core chapters feed the Core and Private exams; aerial chapters feed Aerial
Methods only, so a mock exam never mixes the two. Settings picks which exams
you are studying for, and About lists every NC license and the exams it takes.

**Every question so far comes from a national manual, not a North Carolina
one.** The national manuals are published by the NASDA Research Foundation,
hosted by EPA, and free to read, which is what lets this bank cite them page by
page and link each citation into the PDF. North Carolina's own study texts, the
NC Pesticide Applicator Certification Core Manual and the category manuals, are
sold in print by the
[NC State Pesticide Safety Education Program](https://go.ncsu.edu/psep). They
are adapted from these national manuals and add NC pesticide law and rules,
which the bank does not cover yet. Questions from the NC manuals are planned;
each manual is a separate entry in `data/exam-config.js` with its own citation
prefix and page map, and questions pick theirs with a `manual` field, so
adding one does not disturb what is already there.

This project is a fork of
[nc-cdl-test-training](https://github.com/ullbergm/nc-cdl-test-training): the
same engine studying a different manual. Live at
[nc-pesticide.ullberg.io](https://nc-pesticide.ullberg.io), or run it
yourself. There is no build step, no dependencies, and no server. Just open
`index.html` in a browser. All progress
is stored locally in the browser and never sent anywhere. Settings has export
and import for backups or for moving between devices.

## Modes

- **Study**: the spaced repetition queue. Due reviews plus a daily allotment of new
  cards, drawn round-robin across the selected chapters and interleaved with the
  reviews. Wrong answers come back a few cards later in the same session. Correct
  answers are rated Hard, Good, or Easy, which tells the scheduler how the recall felt.
  Feel like doing more once the queue is empty? The home and session-complete screens
  offer 5, 10, or 25 extra new cards; the extra applies to today only and your
  configured pace is untouched.
- **Misses**: re-drills every question whose last answer was wrong, without touching
  the review schedule. Answering one correctly removes it from the pool.
- **Exam**: mock exams in the real format. No feedback until the end, and 70% to
  pass. The list mirrors the NC exam structure (commercial Core and Private
  Applicator) and shows only the exams selected in Settings. Missed exam
  questions feed the Misses pool.
- **Browse**: the whole bank by manual chapter, with each card's schedule and accuracy.
- **Stats**: exam readiness, mastery counts, day streak, 7-day due forecast,
  per-chapter accuracy, and exam history.

On a keyboard, 1 through 4 pick an answer, Enter continues after a wrong answer,
and 1/2/3 (or Enter for Good) grade a correct one. A stray tap is not final: an
Undo button (or the U key) on the feedback screen takes back the answer and asks
the question again, as long as you have not yet continued or graded. The buttons
show badges for their shortcut keys on devices with a mouse and keyboard; on
touch screens the badges stay hidden.

## Scheduling

The scheduler implements [FSRS-6](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition)
(Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) with its published default parameters. FSRS
models each card with three quantities:

- Difficulty: how hard the card is for you, on a scale of 1 to 10, adjusted by
  each answer.
- Stability: how durable the memory is, measured as the number of days until recall
  probability falls to 90%. Successful reviews grow it, and a miss collapses it.
- Retrievability: the predicted chance of recalling the card right now, which decays
  along a power-law forgetting curve.

Each review updates difficulty and stability from your rating, then schedules the
next review for the day retrievability is predicted to reach the target, shortly
before you would likely forget. Intervals grow quickly for cards you keep getting
right and reset for cards you miss. Repeat answers within the same day use a
separate short-term memory formula. Intervals of three days or more get a small
deterministic fuzz (up to about 5%) so cards learned together drift apart
instead of always coming due on the same day.

Every scheduled review is also appended to a compact log (question, rating,
timestamp) that is kept with your progress and included in backups. Nothing
reads it yet; it exists so a future version can fit the FSRS parameters to
your actual review history instead of the published defaults, which the
aggregate card state alone could never support.

## Studying for a date

Set your test date in Settings and the scheduler optimizes for that day instead of
indefinite retention:

- The retention target ramps from 90% to 95% over the final three weeks.
- No review is scheduled past the exam. Anything that would land later is pulled
  back to exam day.
- If the daily new-card pace is too slow to cover every remaining question in time,
  it is raised automatically. Your stored setting is untouched, the boost is shown
  on the home screen, and it goes away when the date is cleared.
- In the last five days a "Final review sweep" appears on the home screen. It goes
  through every card, weakest memory first, ignoring due dates.

Without an exam date the app runs at your own pace with the normal 90% target. The
same applies automatically once the date passes.

## Am I ready

The home screen projects a score for each exam you are studying for, and Stats
breaks the same projection down with the odds and what is dragging it. Both come
from the memory model the scheduler already maintains, so the number moves with
your actual reviews rather than with a running average of past answers.

Each question is one trial: either the answer is recalled, at the retrievability
FSRS predicts for the moment of the test, or it is not and the guess still lands
one time in four. A question you have never seen is a straight guess. The real
test draws its questions from a much larger pool, so the projected score is the
pool average, and the spread around it accounts for both the draw and the recall
itself. The chance of passing is the probability that the draw clears 70%.

Two counts explain a low projection. Unseen questions are the ones the queue has
not reached yet. Rusty ones have been studied but are predicted to fall below the
90% recall the scheduler targets by test day, which is what the review queue is
there to fix. Without an exam date the projection is for taking the test today.

The projection assumes the bank is representative of the real test, which a bank
covering one chapter so far is not yet, and the real exams also draw on NC law
the bank does not cover. Treat it as a direction, not a score report.

## Layout

```
index.html               app shell
css/style.css            styling (light/dark follows the device; Settings can force either)
js/fsrs.js               FSRS-6 scheduler
js/readiness.js          projected score and pass odds per exam
js/storage.js            localStorage persistence, export/import
js/app.js                UI and session logic
data/questions.js        question bank (30 questions, tagged by chapter and manual page)
data/manual-pages.js     printed page numbers to PDF page numbers, for the citation links
data/exam-config.js      what exam this is: tests, pass mark, manual links, exam-specific prose
tools/                   regenerates that map from a local copy of the manual PDF, and the icons
sw.js                    service worker (offline cache, only active on the hosted site)
manifest.webmanifest     PWA manifest, lets the app be installed to a home screen
icons/                   app icons (icon.svg is the source, PNGs rendered from it)
tests/validate-bank.js   question bank schema checks (node)
tests/fsrs-test.js       FSRS scheduler property tests (node)
tests/readiness-test.js  readiness projection tests, incl. a Monte Carlo check (node)
tests/test.html          end-to-end tests driven through the real UI
tests/run-browser.sh     headless-Chrome runner for test.html (local + CI)
docs/question-authoring.md  the recipe the question bank is written with
docs/screenshots/        README images and the script that regenerates them
```

On the hosted site the app is an installable PWA: a service worker caches
everything on first load, so it keeps working offline, and "Add to home screen"
installs it like an app. Each release stamps its version into the service
worker, so open tabs notice the new deploy, show a "new version is ready"
toast, and switch over cleanly on reload; otherwise the release is picked up
on the next load.

## Building a trainer for another exam

The engine under `js/` knows nothing about pesticides, and the test suites
derive their assertions from the config and the bank, so a trainer for a
different manual-based exam is a matter of replacing data and identity files;
this repository is itself that recipe applied to
[nc-cdl-test-training](https://github.com/ullbergm/nc-cdl-test-training).
Create a new repository from this one and touch:

- `data/questions.js`: the new question bank, tagged by section and manual page;
  [docs/question-authoring.md](docs/question-authoring.md) is the recipe, written
  to be followed by a person or handed to a language model per section
- `data/exam-config.js`: the tests and exams, pass mark, manual links, storage
  keys, and every piece of prose that names the exam
- `data/manual-pages.js`: regenerate with `node tools/gen-manual-pages.js`; the
  footer-label parsing in that script is written for this manual's page
  numbering, so adjust it to the new manual's
- `css/style.css`: the token blocks at the top set all colors and the
  progress-bar texture; the rules below them are exam-neutral
- `index.html`: title, meta description, canonical URL, brand text, favicon,
  theme color
- `manifest.webmanifest`, `icons/`, `CNAME`: PWA identity and hosting; redraw
  `icons/icon.svg` and rerun `tools/gen-icons.sh` for the PNGs
- `package.json`: name and description
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question-correction.yml`: names the manual in its
  field description
- `docs/screenshots/seed.js`: the demo scenario behind the README screenshots
- `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`: name the repository, the live
  site, and the release artifact

The GitHub workflows and the service worker derive their names from the
repository and need no edits. The release tarball is named after the repo, so
`SECURITY.md`'s verification example follows it.

One engine assumption to keep in mind: every question offers exactly four
choices. Manual citations are optional at every level: a question may cite a
page of any manual in the config's `manuals` map, a manual without a public
URL renders its citations as plain text instead of PDF links, and an exam
with nothing citable leaves the map empty and the `page` fields off.

## Releases and deployment

Two workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

- CI (`ci.yml`) validates the question bank and runs the browser test suite on every
  push to `main` and every pull request.
- Release (`release.yml`) uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
  to maintain a release PR from [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  messages. Merging that PR tags a version, publishes a GitHub release with a
  generated changelog, and deploys to GitHub Pages. Ordinary pushes to `main` do not
  touch the live site. The deploy job re-runs the tests before publishing.

To run the checks locally:

```
npm install          # one time, dev tooling only (the app itself has no dependencies)
npm run lint
npm test             # question bank validation, FSRS scheduler, readiness projection
npm run test:browser # end-to-end suite in headless Chrome or Chromium
```

Every line should say `PASS`. Opening `tests/test.html` in a normal browser also
works, with the results printed at the bottom of the page. The test page clears the
app's localStorage for its origin, so do not run it in the browser profile where you
keep real study progress.

## Accuracy

The questions were authored from the manual's text, chapter by chapter. Accuracy is
not guaranteed. Each question carries the manual page it came from (like `14`) and
links to that page in the PDF, so verify anything important against the source. The
actual exam questions are not publicly available, and no claim is made that these
questions match or resemble them. This is a study aid for the manual's content, not
a copy of the test. If a question reads wrong, check the cited page and edit
`data/questions.js`, which is a plain JSON array.

Both manual PDFs are published by the NASDA Research Foundation and hosted by EPA;
neither is included in this repository. Download them from the EPA links above.

The citation links point into those hosted PDFs with a `#page=` fragment, which counts
physical pages rather than the page numbers printed in the footers, so a page map
translates between the two: `data/manual-pages.js` for the core manual and
`data/aerial-pages.js` for the aerial one. The maps are built from the 2014 editions;
if a new edition is published, download it and re-run the generator (needs
`pdftotext`) so the links keep landing on the right pages:

```sh
node tools/gen-manual-pages.js                       # core manual
node tools/gen-manual-pages.js aerial-applicator-manual.pdf \
  --out data/aerial-pages.js --var AERIAL_PAGES      # aerial manual
```
